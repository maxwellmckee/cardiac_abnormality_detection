# ECG Abnormality Detection

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Python-based machine learning approach to detect cardiac abnormalities from ECG signals. By analyzing ECG data as functional data and employing B-splines, Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), and Random Forest classification, this project aims to enhance the detection accuracy and promptness of identifying abnormal heart activities.

## Data Source
- Training Data: `ecg_train`
- Testing Data: `ecg_test`
Both datasets are sourced from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive.

## Key Features
- **Functional Data Analysis**: Utilizes B-splines and FPCA for feature extraction from ECG signals.
- **Machine Learning Classification**: Applies a Random Forest classifier to differentiate between normal and abnormal ECG signals.
- **Objective**: To improve the reliability and efficiency of cardiac disease detection processes.

## Requirements
- Python
- `Numpy`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Seaborn`
- `Scikit-learn`
- `Scikit-fda`
